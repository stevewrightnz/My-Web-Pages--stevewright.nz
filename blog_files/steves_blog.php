		<h3>01 January 2017</h3>
		<p>Got some more tidy up done.</p>
		<h3>27 October 2016</h3>
		<h4>Update</h4>
		<p>Mostly sorted comments section - managed to get reCaptcha working ok.  Moderation methodology to go but it's up and live for now.</p>
		<p>Might also look at limiting the number of tweets sent by my speedtest routine.  Might just tweet the slow ones?</p>		
		<h3>14 October 2016</h3>
		<h4>Update</h4>
		<p>Website reformat mostly done. <br>Finally finished reformatting the website. <br>Lots to learn including some perl to monitor the internet connection.</p>		
		<p>Speedtest is improved a bit too. <br> <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5713653610"><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/5713653610.png" alt="speedtest"/></a></p>
		<p>Still a few things to do to get it to where I really want it.  Need to sort the reCaptcha for the comments section before it goes into production.  I'm
		   sure it's something simple but it's not working properly at the moment.</p>

		<h4>Vodafone Speed Test</h4>
		<p>Stunning speeds from Vodafone tonight. NOT! Looks like 6% of the country actually puts up with slower speeds which is 
		really sad.  Roll on access to fibre, at least there will be a choice then.<p>

		<h3>18 April 2016</h3>
		<p>Really struggling to get ZoneMinder to work on apache2 with proxypass.</p>
		<h3>31 March 2016</h3>
		<p>Got me a ChromeCast audio to replace the faulty cable.  Works a treat.</p>
		<h3>27 March 2016</h3>
		<h4>6:01pm</h4>
		<p>Stereo playing up;  need at least one new cable; jerry rigged to make noise tonight! </p>
		<h4>11:35am</h4>
		<p>Started re-formating the website - still a bit to do!  Learning a bit about CSS and other bits and pieces.</p>
		<p>Need to add a comments section to the blog page and move some of the content around around on the rest of the site.</p>
