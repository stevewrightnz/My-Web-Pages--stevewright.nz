		<p>The information in these pages is the result of a couple of years research.  Initial research on the Wright side of the family was carried out 
		by Nicko's Grandaunt. The remaining research has generally been based on freely available internet records (I'm too tight to pay for stuff if 
		I don't have to).  
		
		The root person is Nicholas "Nicko" Wright and the information attempts to capture both his parents families.</p>
		
		<p>Only the direct line is published here, as that is all the software will allow. There are some links to historical figures in other branches in the other
		stuff we have. If you think something is missing, you want more information or that the full story is not told then feel free to contact us;
		there is a possibility that we will be able to help or point you in the right direction.</p>
		
		<p> We are constantly looking for further information and facts so any other information is welcomed.</p>
		
		<h2>The New Zealand branch of the Wright Family of Bolton upon Swale</h2>
		
		<p>Back in 1962 or 1963 Nicko's grandparents uprooted the family from the West Midlands in England and emigrated to Wellington, New Zealand with the 
		intention of staying for a couple of years.</p>
		
		<p>The first stop was 5 Cornwall Street in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Hutt' target=_blank> Lower Hutt</a>.  
		The second was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birchville' target=_blank> Birchville</a>, 
		just north of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Hutt' target=_blank> Upper Hutt</a>, where they still live.</p>
		
		<p>Their children attended Te Marua/Brown Owl School followed by Maidstone Intermediate, Upper Hutt College and various 
		tertiary institutions in the lower North Island.
		The family remains based in the lower North Island of New Zealand.</p>
