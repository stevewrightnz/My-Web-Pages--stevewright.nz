	<h3>Vodafone Service</h3>
	<p>Well I've finally had enough of the poor speeds I get from my Vodafone Fibre X Service.</p>
	<p>I'm on a 200/20 Fibre X service and at the least expect to get 180/18 ALL the time. </p>
	<p>I don't see that as unreasonable as even that gives them a 20% margin to stuff things up.</p>
	<p>Since the middle of January when I got the service I have been running and collecting speedtest 
	   results every 4 hours.</p>
	<p></p>
